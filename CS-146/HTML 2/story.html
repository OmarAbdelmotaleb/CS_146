        <p class = "pstyle">I met this one friend in an online community while playing a game and we didn't really know each other too well or talk to each other much for a while.
            We obviously knew who we were but didn't hang out much.</p> 
            
        <p class = "pstyle">Later though, a mutual friend had brought us all together, along with a bunch of 
            other friends met in that online community, and we ended up talking ever since. We found we had a lot in common. He's currently a senior in
            high school and he lived in New York.</p>

        <p class = "pstyle">I didn't have the ability to go by myself really due to time constraints and other factors, like parents
            at the time. Luckily, I was able to tour New York and see a bunch of places during pre-orientation at Stevens. I convinced him to meet me at
            Central Park and was able to see him for the first time. We got to chill for a bit but eventually had to head out. It was great getting to see him
            for the first time and I look forward to being able to see a few of my other friends in New York in the future.</p>
